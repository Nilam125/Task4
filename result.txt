Optimization Results:
 Variable  Optimal_Value
Product_A           70.0
Product_B           15.0

Total Profit: 4100.0


1. The optimal solution suggests producing 70.0 units of Product A and 15.0 units of Product B.
2. The maximum achievable profit is $4100.0.
3. The machine time constraint and labor time constraint are binding at optimal levels, 
   meaning they are fully utilized in the optimal solution.
4. If more resources are available (e.g., additional machine or labor hours), the profit could increase further.
